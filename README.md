<p align="center">🍷🧠 WineBOX – Cognitive Technology for Real Lives</p>
<p align="center"> A next-generation cognitive stimulation system built for hospitals, therapists, and families. Designed for neurodiversity. Powered by human professionals. Rooted in real technology. </p> <p align="center"> <img src="/src/cap2.png" width="500"> </p>
⭐ What is WineBOX?

WineBOX is a cognitive stimulation environment designed for children and adults with:

Autism (TEA)

Attention difficulties

Cognitive delay

Memory deficits

Emotional dysregulation

Executive function challenges

Built by a team of neuro-pediatric specialists, neuropsychologists, and developers, WineBOX delivers:

✔ Cognitive tasks
✔ Emotional regulation modules
✔ Sensory-friendly interfaces
✔ Therapist-customized exercises
✔ Per-patient adaptive content
✔ Professional oversight by humans (NO automated AI therapy)

WineBOX is currently undergoing expansion thanks to Kickstarter backers, enabling the creation of:

A full ARM Linux cognitive tablet

A dedicated APK

Custom treatment modules for institutions

A neuro-focused desktop environment

A full-time interdisciplinary clinical team

🚀 Mission

To bring structured, therapist-guided cognitive stimulation to families and institutions worldwide — at accessible cost, high quality, and with real human professional support.

WineBOX exists because:

Millions of families do not have access to continuous cognitive therapy.
Hospitals lack modular digital tools.
Therapists need adaptable, rapid-deployment modules tailored to each patient.

WineBOX bridges that gap — technologically, clinically, and humanly.

🍷 About WineBOX

WineBOX began as an experimental environment called Freedows 8-Bit, a fully functional Windows-compatible runtime running on Android without root, built using:

Termux

Proot

Box64

Termux-X11

Wine / Proton

Over time, something unexpected happened:

👀 Clinical professionals noticed something important:
Children interacting with the environment showed consistent engagement patterns, strengthening:

Visual-spatial attention

Working memory

Sequential reasoning

Emotional tolerance

Task focus

This transformed the project from a technical curiosity into an evidence-inspired cognitive stimulation platform.

Today WineBOX is a fully redefined system, evolving into an advanced ARM-based therapy companion for clinics and families.

🧠 Modern WineBOX ARM System

The new WineBOX is built on:

ARM Linux OS (customized)

32-bit & 64-bit compatibility

Direct DEB package installation

Optimized memory footprint

Real-time cognitive modules

Cognitive dashboard for clinicians

Secure cloud-linked data channels

Therapist-customizable stimuli

Unlike automated AI systems, WineBOX is supervised by:

✔ Neuropsychologists
✔ Neuro pediatricians
✔ Psychiatrists
✔ Cognitive researchers
✔ Developers specialized in adaptative content

Every module can be tailored per institution and per patient, like a digital “compounded treatment”.

🕰️ Legacy WineBOX (Historical Build)

(Preserved for educational and technical reference)

The original WineBOX was a full desktop environment running entirely inside Android — without root, using only Termux and proot.

This historical version is kept here to honor the origin of the system and demonstrate the evolution of the technology.

🟧 Termux Runtime – Historical Installation
1. Install Termux and Termux-X11

(legacy builds used by the original WineBOX)

Termux
https://github.com/ifilex/Freedows8Bit/releases/download/apks/termux.apk

Termux-X11
https://github.com/ifilex/Freedows8Bit/releases/download/apks/termux-x11.apk

2. Run the WineBOX installer

Open Termux:

curl -o install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifilex/Freedows8Bit/main/src/install.sh && chmod +x install && ./install

3. Launch WineBOX
winebox


This starts Termux-X11 and shows the legacy desktop interface.

Termux-X11 Recommended Settings

Display resolution mode: Exact

Resolution: 800x600

Fullscreen: ON

Force landscape: ON

Prefer scancodes: ON

Hide cutout: ON

Support

Android 10+ recommended

ARM64 devices preferred

No root required
