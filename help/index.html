	<h2>How to play?</h2>
	<p>Just select the game you want to play, and the system will download its content from the cloud so you can enjoy it on your computer.</p>
	<h2>Developers</h2>
	<p>If you are a developer you can port your application or game to obtain a monetary return within our platform on a monthly basis. To do this, you must first enter the development console, it is located in the Z:\ icon of the main menu. The SDK is made up of the BORLAND C, TURBO C, DJGPP and NASM compilers, all with graphical libraries for game and application development. Once your application works correctly within the SDK, you can export it by sending it in compressed format, if possible with a name and icon, attaching your ERC20 wallet to the email: 8bitfarm.nft@gmail.com, later we will publish your application within the store , starting to receive from the 1st to the 5th of each month a total of 30 NFT in your declared wallet.</p>
